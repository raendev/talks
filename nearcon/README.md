ðŸŒ§ Make it RAEN: tooling for ambitious Open Web apps
===========================

A talk about the current state of RAEN and a vision of what it could become.

See root README for info on how the slides are built and how to run them.


Talk Description
================

The biggest gap in NEAR's current tooling & education exists between "hackathon Proof-of-Concept" and "full-scale app". How's a hacker to evolve a weekend project into a well-architected codebase that serves a userbase of millions? What are the best current patterns for building on the Open Web, and how can a builder upgrade to the latest patterns "for free", harnessing the research and development of the whole ecosystem, rather than re-performing the research themselves?

RAEN has already laid the foundation for tooling that answers these questions. We'll learn how it works now, where it's headed, how to get started (so easy!), and how to get involved.
