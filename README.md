ðŸŒ§ RAEN Talks
=============

Slides for talks by the RAEN team. See subfolders for specific presentations.

All slides are built using [remarkjs](https://github.com/gnab/remark), which allows writing slides in markdown and turns them into beautiful, browser-powered slides complete with speaker notes. Read its readme to find out more about it.

To run locally:

- `npm install -g serve`
- `serve .`
