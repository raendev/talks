ðŸŒ§ Aha Labs 2022pt2: a pitch for NEAR Foundation funding
========================================================

A short version of [../nf-pitch](../nf-pitch) meant as a standalone Pitch Deck, for reading rather than for accompanying a spoken talk.

The biggest gap in NEAR's current tooling & education exists between "hackathon Proof-of-Concept" and "full-scale app". How's a hacker to evolve a weekend project into a well-architected codebase that serves a userbase of millions? What are the best current patterns for building on the Open Web, and how can a builder upgrade to the latest patterns "for free", harnessing the research and development of the whole ecosystem, rather than re-performing the research themselves?

RAEN has already laid the foundation for tooling that answers these questions. This grant will give us six months of runway to expand this offering, allowing us to evolve it into the "Ruby on Rails" of the Open Web: a framework, CLI tool, and related infrastructure to allow builders to quickly iterate on ambitious decentralized apps.

Central to the Open Web vision are thin apps that access open data. That is, apps that incorporate data from many smart contracts. RAEN will support this in three ways: 1. Making it easy to build apps that integrate with existing, deployed smart contracts; 2. Building a no-code "Contract Store" app that allows people to quickly launch their own version of a contract, such as the many NFT projects that forked the TENK smart contract with minor modification (for a partial list, see https://ahalabs.dev/posts/near-edu-fellowship-recap); and 3. Providing OpenZeppelin-type templates and building blocks, giving smart contract authors quick starting points and secure patterns to build on.
